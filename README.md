# ðŸ“Š Digital Marketing Analysis

### Summary

I analyzed 28 days of marketing data to see how different campaigns (Social, Influencer, Media, and Search) are performing. The focus was on **costs, leads, orders, and revenue**.

Key points:

* **Orders and revenue move together** â€“ more orders bring more revenue.
* **Day 20 showed a big jump in revenue** from Banner, YouTube, and Instagram.
* **Half of the total leads and nearly half of the revenue** came from just three campaigns.
* **Banner and Search campaigns are cost-friendly**, while Influencer campaigns are expensive but give higher visibility.

---

### 1. Cost Efficiency

* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Lowest in Banner and Search campaigns.
* **Cost per Click (CPC):** Highest in Influencer campaigns.
* **Cost per Lead (CPL):** Media campaigns got more leads but at a higher cost.

ðŸ‘‰ **What it means:** Focus more on Banner and Search to save money. For Influencer campaigns, try to control costs.

---

### 2. Revenue & Orders

* Revenue increases only when **orders increase**.
* **Average Order Value (AOV):** Mostly the same across campaigns.
* On **Day 20**, Banner, YouTube, and Instagram together gave **50% of all leads and 48% of revenue**.

ðŸ‘‰ **What it means:** Big campaigns can bring a lot of results, but relying only on them is risky.

### 3. Conversion Rates

* **CR1 (Clicks Ã· Impressions):** Influencers get more clicks but are not always efficient.
* **CR2 (Leads Ã· Clicks):** Banner and Social campaigns turn more clicks into real leads.

ðŸ‘‰ **What it means:** Focus on campaigns that not only get attention but also bring leads.

### 4. Category Performance

* **Social & Influencer:** Bring attention and leads but cost more.
* **Media (Banner/YouTube):** Give high returns with stable conversions.
* **Search:** Gives steady but smaller results.

### 5. Suggestions

1. Put more money into **Banner and YouTube** campaigns.
2. Cut costs on **Influencers** or use smaller influencers (cheaper but effective).
3. Donâ€™t depend only on **3 campaigns** for revenue.
4. Always check **conversion rates**, not just clicks or impressions.
5. Test new ideas in Search campaigns to improve them.
